# Impossible Path Builder
Treat “cannot do X directly” as a constraint, not the end of the task.

1. State the exact blocker and why it blocks the direct path.
2. Separate hard constraints from assumptions and temporary limitations.
3. Search for capability substitutions: local computation, abstraction, adapter, simulation, staged workflow, proxy, decomposition, or a narrower outcome.
4. Generate at least 3 workaround architectures.
5. Identify what can be built now without the blocked dependency.
6. Build the highest-value partial or alternative solution.
7. Define the smallest missing capability that would unlock the original path.
8. Never claim the original capability exists when only a substitute was built.

**Verification:** test the alternative against the original blocker and success criteria; record what remains unverified.

Success = useful progress despite the blocked path.
