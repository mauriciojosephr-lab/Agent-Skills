# Capability sources — 2026-09-26

This file records sources to mine for implementation patterns. It is not proof that a source is integrated.

## Existing collection sources
- Project-/COLLECTION: canonical collection index and provenance graph.
- aw-junaid: 33 repositories.
- mufeedvh: 43 repositories.
- Panniantong: 38 repositories.
- Nmap ecosystem: 7 repositories.
- Weekly Top Five.
- Agent Reach families.
- mnfst/awesome-free-llm-apis.

## Additional GitHub sources discovered during the operator build
- incline-ltd/awesome-agentic-engineering — agent workflows, MCP, verification, sandboxing, security patterns.
- uber/ADR — agent discovery, telemetry, benchmark and defensive detection.
- msoedov/agentic_security — LLM/agent vulnerability scanning and red-team evaluation.
- secureagentics/Adrian — runtime agent monitoring and intervention patterns.
- github/gh-aw — GitHub-native agentic workflows with sandboxing, scoped permissions, gated outputs and cost controls.
- cohaaan/all-agentic-coding-tools — landscape of coding agents and capability dimensions.
- Ryvos/ryvos — self-hosted agent runtime with tools, DAG orchestration, MCP and sandboxing.
- Corvidae-Coding-Projects/OpenClaudia — agent harness/provider/session/tool/review architecture; treat its own audit warnings as evidence that presence is not readiness.

## Promotion rule
A source becomes an Operator capability only after:
1. source/revision is recorded;
2. license/dependency/cost boundary is known;
3. implementation is inspected;
4. adapter contract is defined;
5. local fixture or runtime test passes;
6. health/reachability is measured;
7. independent verification evidence exists.

Never equate a catalog entry, star count, README claim or Top Five membership with operational capability.

- multica-ai/multica — agent workspace/runtime/task-routing patterns: agent identity, runtime separation, durable runs, review gates, skills, access scopes, autopilot scheduling. Source inspection completed; license boundary requires exact LICENSE review before code reuse.

- rohitg00/ai-engineering-from-scratch — 20-phase AI engineering curriculum, 523 lessons, runnable artifacts, focused MCP/Agent Skills routes, agent-assisted engineering, production AI, safety, and capstone implementations. MIT license verified from LICENSE. Use as a knowledge/pattern source; do not equate curriculum completion with operational capability.

- trycua/cua — computer-use infrastructure: Cua Driver (MCP/CLI/SDK), isolated sandboxes/fleets, Lume VMs, Cua Bench, CUA-S1. MIT core license verified; optional perception/OmniParser/Ultralytics components have separate AGPL/CC-BY boundaries. Use as a scoped GUI capability source, never as unrestricted desktop authority.

- cporter202/openclaw-api-list — agent-callable API/MCP discovery catalog. Focus and curated-list files inspected 2026-09-27. High-value patterns: API→capability discovery, bounded OpenAPI→MCP generation, MCP as transport, free/self-hosted-first selection. Catalog entries are discovery only; provider ownership, license, cost, security and runtime must be independently verified.

- ruvnet/ruflo — agent meta-harness: swarm/orchestration, adaptive planning, persistent memory, model routing, hooks, security/readiness audits, and witness/receipt verification. MIT license verified. Inspected 2026-09-27. High-value patterns captured in Project-/COLLECTION/AI/RUFLO_CAPTURE_2026-09-27.md. Use as architecture/pattern source; do not equate Ruflo features with operator capability until independently tested.
