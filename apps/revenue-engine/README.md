# Revenue Engine

A provider-neutral, fail-closed revenue operating system for five monetization paths:

1. Affiliate offers
2. Digital products
3. APIs
4. Micro-SaaS
5. Opportunity/data products

The engine does not pretend that credits, impressions, or simulated executions are cash. It creates opportunities, scores them, generates a deterministic execution plan, and refuses to claim revenue until a real provider/event confirms it.

## Architecture

`discover -> verify -> score -> route -> package -> publish -> measure -> learn`

Every opportunity can fan out into multiple monetization surfaces. The same source opportunity may become an affiliate deal, a digital product, an API idea, a SaaS experiment, and/or a paid data alert.

## Live execution and recovery

The live provider boundary is implemented in `live-provider-adapters.mjs`. It:

- requires HTTPS provider endpoints;
- supports bearer-token authentication without storing credentials in source;
- performs provider health checks;
- retries transient network failures and HTTP 408/425/429/5xx responses with bounded backoff and `Retry-After` support;
- preserves explicit provider errors when the retry budget is exhausted;
- signs and verifies revenue webhook events with HMAC-SHA256.

`revenue-operator.mjs live-probe` performs an automated provider reachability probe when live endpoints are configured. A probe is deliberately **not** treated as revenue and never records a fabricated event. Production activation still requires a real provider integration and a confirmed provider event.

## Safety / anti-regression rules

- No provider credentials are stored in source.
- No self-referrals, fake accounts, cookie stuffing, spam, or deceptive claims.
- Provider adapters are explicit and disabled until configured and integration-tested.
- Revenue is recorded only from confirmed events.
- Unknown or unverified offers are blocked from publishing.
- The core remains runnable with zero external credentials in deterministic dry-run mode.

## Run

```bash
node apps/revenue-engine/revenue-engine.mjs
node apps/revenue-engine/test-revenue-engine.mjs
node apps/revenue-engine/revenue-operator.mjs live-probe
```

## First milestone

The first milestone is intentionally not a giant UI. It is a tested operating core that can be connected to real discovery, affiliate, publishing, payment, and analytics providers without rewriting the business logic.


### MONY entry-link contract

`GET /api/revenue/affiliate-link` returns two distinct links:
- `trackingUrl`: the MONY-owned internal workbench entry path (`/api/revenue/mony/workbench`).
- `partnerTrackingUrl`: the external affiliate-provider tracking URL.

The customer remains inside MONY first; the external partner URL is an optional disclosed handoff. Revenue is recorded only from confirmed qualifying reward events.
