# Army 14 — Software Factory Soldiers

The commander is outside this roster. These fourteen are execution soldiers. Each soldier has a primary mission and a composed skill arsenal. Existing repository skills are reused rather than duplicated.

## Factory doctrine

A soldier must inspect the real target state before acting. A plan is not an implementation. A commit is not verification. When something fails, the soldier must find the cause, repair it, test it, and verify the resulting state. Existing capabilities must be reused when they already solve the problem. Secrets and private credentials never enter source, logs, or artifacts.

The fourteen soldiers are designed to compose: Research → Architect → Product/MVP → Builder → UI/Backend/Database/Integrations/AI → Security → Test/QA → Browser/E2E → Debug/Repair → Deployment/Ops. The commander decides sequencing and parallelism.

## Elite capability stage

All fourteen profiles now carry a role-specific **Elite capability contract** and **Elite operating mode**. Elite stage means the soldier must execute a complete inspect → act → test → adversarial review → repair → verify → evidence loop appropriate to its mission. A soldier is not considered complete merely because its profile exists or a commit succeeds.

The benchmark gates are role-aware rather than a generic score: each soldier must satisfy its mission-specific quality bar, explicit Elite contract, evidence requirements, and the repository-wide safety rules. Failed gates block completion.

## Definition of ready

A new application request is ready for handoff only when the relevant soldiers have produced executable artifacts and evidence: source, tests, configuration boundaries, and—when deployment is requested—a verified running deployment. Blockers must remain explicit rather than being disguised as success.

## Verification

The roster is enforced by `.github/workflows/army-14-validation.yml`, which checks the exact 14 profiles, required operating sections, registry entries, and basic secret-like patterns.

The Elite stage is enforced by `.github/workflows/army-14-elite-gate.yml`, which checks all 14 profiles for the Elite capability contract, Elite operating mode, quality/verification sections, exact roster count, and basic secret-like patterns.
